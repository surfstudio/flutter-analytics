## Overview

Interface for working with analytic services.
The library is supposed to unify work with various analytic services. The main actors are:

* **AnalyticAction** ‚Äî any action that is valuable for analytics. Usually it is a "button pressed" or "screen opened" type of event but the main criterion is a possibility to be handled by `AnalyticStrategy`.
* **AnalyticActionPerformer** - an interface for analytic action performers. This class is an abstract base class for analytic strategies.
* **AnalyticStrategy** ‚Äî a class that provides a special way to send an analytical action. To create a custom analytic strategy, you should extend this class and implement the `performAction` method.
* **AnalyticService** ‚Äî a class that provides a way to send analytic action using a set of analytic strategies. To use this class, you should create an instance of it with a set of analytic strategies, and then call the `performAction` method to send analytic action.

## Example

The easiest interaction with the library is as follows:

1. Determine the actions that ought to be recorded in the analytics service:

    ```dart
    class MyAnalyticAction implements AnalyticAction {
        final String key;
        final String value;

        MyAnalyticAction(this.key, this.value);
    }

    class ButtonPressedAction extends MyAnalyticAction {
        ButtonPressedAction() : super("button_pressed", null);
    }

    class ScreenOpenedAction extends MyAnalyticAction {
        ScreenOpenedAction({String param}) : super("screen_opened", param);
    }
    ```

2. Implement analytic strategy:

    ```dart
    class MyAnalyticStrategy
        extends AnalyticStrategy<MyAnalyticAction> {
        final SomeAnalyticsApi _analyticsApi;

        SomeAnalyticsApi(this._analyticsApi);

        @override
        void performAction(MyAnalyticAction action) {
            _analyticsApi.send(action.key, action.value);
        }
    }
    ```

3. Create an AnalyticService with your strategy:

    ```dart
    final analyticService = AnalyticService.withStrategies({
        MyAnalyticStrategy(analytics),
    });
    ```

Usage:

```dart
    analyticService.performAction(ButtonPressedAction());
```

## Installation

Add `analytics` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  analytics: $currentVersion$
```

<p>At this moment, the current version of <code>analytics</code> is <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/analytics"><img style="vertical-align:middle;" src="https://img.shields.io/pub/v/analytics.svg" alt="analytics version"></a>.</p>

## Migrating from 1.x.x to 2.x.x

1.x.x

```dart
    final analyticService = DefaultAnalyticService();
    analyticService.addActionPerformer(
        MyAnalyticActionPerformer(SomeAnalyticService()),
    );
```

Starting from version 2.0.0, sending an event to a specific analytics service is implemented using strategies. The `AnalyticService` class stores these strategies. Implement analytics strategies using the `AnalyticStrategy` egy class.

```dart
    final analyticService = AnalyticService.withStrategies({
        MyAnalyticStrategy(analytics),
    });
```
